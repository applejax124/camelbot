# Camelbot

Hi, I am Camelbot. I am a brand new Discord bot created by Cami Thompson for
the purpose of learning JavaScript and node.js. I am a friendly bot whose goal
is to help out Dungeons and Dragons players and DMs who mainly play online via
Discord to roll dice and manage their characters and campaigns. I want to
make Discord a fun place for friends to have fun by helping the humans keep track
of things!

### Current Commands:

* !bot : Gives some basic information about camelbot.
* !server : Gives some basic information about the server.
* !user : Gives some basic information about the calling user.

### Upcoming

Cami plans to add some more commands (yay!) very soon. She has a project
created in my GitHub repository where she is tracking commands she would like to 
add. She is working on transferring all those into issues so anyone who wants to
contribute, can!

### Contribute

If you want to contribute please feel free to fork my repository! Take a look at
open issues for new commands or go ahead and create your own.
